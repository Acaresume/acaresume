## How this project works

All the resumes are simple HTML + CSS templates which are made editable using the global attribute `contenteditable`.

## How to add a new template?

1) Create a `college-name` folder in `templates` folder. This folder contains the HTML of the resume template.
2) Create the `CSS` for the resume and keep it in `css` folder. Make sure you follow the naming convention for files.
3) Add the resume in the dropdown in the `index.html` file.
4) You did it.
